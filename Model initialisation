Model initialisation

Type this is matlab command window before simulation - 
(You can change these parameters according to you)


% ABS Model Initialization
m = 1500;  % Vehicle mass
R = 0.3;   % Wheel radius
v0 = 20;   % Initial vehicle speed
I = 2;     % Wheel moment of inertia
>> g = 9.81; % Acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)
